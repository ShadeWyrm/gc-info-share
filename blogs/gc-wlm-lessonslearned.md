# GCEARB Workload Migration Cloud Lessons Learned

This is a collection of the lessons learned across a number of departments in the pathfinder challenge of moving workloads from data centers to the Cloud. Lessons are in no paticular order, and come from presentations at the Goverment of Canada Enterprise Architectural Review Board.

## 1) Retention Retention Retention

Your best staff will be poached by private industry, other crown and especially other Departments. 
Treat them right and give them the positions and agency they deserve.

## 2) Agility and Discipline

Technology now changes so rapidly that departments not just should but MUST be able to pivot. 
Adopt Agile methodologies, and practice discipline in their implementation across the whole organization.

## 3) Strong Leaders Only 
Adoption of Agile, Working in the Open, Cloud and Inclusive Design MUST be supported vocally and consistently by ALL senior leadership.

Clear, concise and consistent communication is a requirement.

## 4) Communication

Macro (Dept<>TBS<>SSC) and Micro (Exec<>Managment<>Staff) needs to be done early, often, and truthfully. 
Be transparent, and accurate, misinformation and late information will only hurt us all.

## 5) Buyer Beware 

While lots of things are released and tested on the open market, they don't necessarily function as intended.
Make sure you add contingency time to account for this, as there may be a lot of back and forth.

## 6) Cloud is a Journey
Not a destination. 
It is complex, and will always take longer than you think. 
Start now, start small, start simple - but whatever you do. 
Start.
You will fail along the way somewhere, and that's ok.

## 7) Change is Hard

Cloud requires a major culture shift, especially as individuals will need to adapt to radically different roles. Do not underestimate the power fear has over people. Organizational change management is a must.

## 8) Cost is Your Responsibility 

Watch the costs of your Cloud services - you will know within a matter of hours if a grievous error has been made; assuming you are monitoring and logging costs.

Misused Cloud is very expensive.

## 9) Its Dangerous to Go Alone

Partner with others, leverage the expertise of others who have gone before you.

Those teams working in the open, and making their scripts, code and knowledge #opensource are more likely to succeed.
