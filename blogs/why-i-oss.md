One of the questions I've been asked a lot is why I care about #opensource at a personal level. Here are the two major lessons I learnt in my first decade as a Public Servant.

# "Your Work can be Destroyed at any Time"

I started in the GC as a student using the FSWEP Program. Here I was tasked by a series of Business Testers to handle what essentially was electronic filling of documents; They gave me the summer to do it.

I have a love/hate relationship with work. I like doing a new thing! I love learning, but after the first time the vast majority of activities  lose their luster rapidly. So I automate it, which almost always means I'm asked to do more. 

So I was asked to join the team of System Testers who had an ambitious plan to automate testing. There I was mentored and coached in Architecure and Design by an absolutely amazing CS-04. Seriously talented, as comfortable reading C# as he was in Cobol.

We started in a COTS solution, it worked well. It brought testing times down from months of effort to days, but I hated it. That 'love/hate' relationship kicked in because it required lots of maintenance.

So I proposed ripping out the COTS solution and building it up on our own. It was approved to be worked on during our downtime months (it was a cyclical process) by an absolutely amazing DG who was passionate about hearing young folks ideas.

A grand success, I cut down the cost of multiple 10,000$ licenses the Department was paying for - and developed a rudimentary form of pattern recognition so that there was no maintenance required outside of implementing new patterns. Eg: Adding PowerBuilder apps or OracleForms needed a new pattern to identify controls and labels.

By the end it had Mainframe Termimals, HTML 4, HTML 5, WinForms and Powebuilder as applications that could take a human readable inputs and was supported by an inverse implementation of the pattern recognition for recording the same items.

Then we had a change in Government and my entire management chain retired. I had a new Team Lead, new Manager, new Director, new Senior Director, new Director General, new Assistant Deputy Minister, new Deputy Minister and new Minister.

Software developed in house was deemed unaligned, and would not be supported. A new project was launched to configure a COTS solution. I was invited to participate as a member of the working group for consultation purposes but was told to remain maintaining my engine. 

I provided advice, and instructions on what was required, but was told repeatedly by this new team that I clearly had no idea what I was talking about, and that they'd request my opinion only if they needed. They knew better then a CS-02 being 3's and 4's.

During this time I started having serious health issues, combined with workplace 2.0, an open concept workspace designed for individual teams and yet applied to a full floor of 250+, combined with being told to not work on anything but requests to run my engine for testing but to "look busy" so that other staff wouldn't complain about me led to some serious depression.

So I left. 

The code for my tools no longer exists, and the testing team in question went back to manual testing. The COTS solution never delivered.

## The Lesson

While nothing you do in the GC is your own, good stewardship and Open Source allows other Departments to leverage your talent through reusable solutions.

# "You have no experience, unless someone sees it."

As I recovered with the help of therapy and doctors at a calmer new department I began to take on more and more responsibility in support of my team. I mentored junior developers, I implemented code reviews, and slowly crept in DevOps practices. 

I saved over six projects from Death March status that had been eating millions of tax payer dollars for nothing.

Then we had a massive shuffle and reorg, where I was left with no management between myself and the acting Senior Director. I continued to support my team, kept the projects I was associated with healthy and saw that they released to production and got used. 

The Acting Senior Director left, I was placed on a completely new team and had all my experience, trust and freedom completely go poof. I had no one to validate my experience or what I had done but individuals who had left the Department which immediately made them suspect of what they had to say.

I naively felt that I could move up in levels based on merit. If I worked hard, showed I had the potential to solve huge problems and spent time building trust the Department would invest in me.

Instead, I was shot down because those in power didn't explicitly see my work. 

## The Lesson 

Working in the open shows the whole world what you're capable of. Potential can be easily identified, which in turn means Executives are far more willing to take a 'risk' on you.
