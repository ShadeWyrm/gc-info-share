3. Video/Audio Conferencing
999. Email : Only for non-urgent requests / non-transitory information. *(I do not like emails.)*

## Work Patterns
The best way you can help me, and work with me.
* My Environment directly contributes to my motivation. Toxic environments will quickly demotivate me, this should not be confused with stressful or chaotic environments. Even if something isn't going well, make jokes, and have fun with me and we can beat it, but wallow in it and I can't help you or myself!
* Give me boring work you hate. I'll find a way to make it more bearable, or eliminate it from the processes entirely. Do not give me things you want to keep as is.
* Give me your priorities so I can ensure they are met.

## Misunderstandings
Things people might take away from interacting with me that aren't correct.
* I am not quick to trust others, it is an area I'm working on. If you feel I haven't given you the trust you deserve, please let me know.
* I have high standards, and will not allow quality to slide if I care about a project. This can feel uncompromising and stubborn, and is tied to the above.
* It can be easy to mistake my passion and determination for abrasion or anger. Let me know if I'm coming off that way so I can change my communication.
